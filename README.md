# COFFEE BY M

## BACKGROUND
Coffee by M is your go-to source for data visualization related to coffee. From industry associations pulications to lab research, interesting insights about coffee will be regularly updated here.

## FUNCTIONALITY & MVP

### MVP1 COFFEE PRODUCTION 

* Data Format: Animated Tree Map (See example at: https://observablehq.com/@d3/animated-treemap)
* Data Source: ICO coffee total production time series by country (http://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp)
* Functionality: User should be able to see an animated chart of how coffee production is distributed by region and batch.

### MVP2 COFFEE PRICE

* Data Format: Connected Scatter Plot (See example at: https://observablehq.com/@d3/connected-scatterplot)
* Data Source: ICO coffee price (http://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp)
* x-axis: price to growers;
* y-axis: retail price;
* Functionality: User should be able to see the growth of coffee retail price in co-efficiency with price paid to growers and witness the gap;

### MVP3 COFFEE CONSUMPTION

### MVP4 COFFEE GENOME LIFE OF TREES

* Data Format: Life of Trees (See example at: https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/tree-of-life)
* Data Source: World coffee research open Genome tree (https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/news/first-fully-open-access-coffea-arabica-genome-sequence-released/)
* Functionality: User should be able to tell where coffees are originated from, and identify the path of gene transformation of a given coffee;
* Risk dependency: Understand gff file and Geno mapping;

### MVP5 STARBUCKS LOCATIONS TRACE

* Data Format: Walmart Growth (See example at: https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/walmarts-growth)
* Data Source: Starbucks Official Site;
* Functionality: User should be able to see the expansion and withdraw (in 2020) of starbucks stores in US.

## IMPLEMENTING TIMELINE
* D1 MVP1 + Website frame
* D2 MVP2
* D3 MVP3
* D4 MVP4 / may switch out with other diagrams if converting gff didn't work
* d5 MVP5 / may switch out with other diagrams if scrapping didn't work
